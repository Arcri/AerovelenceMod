This shader is a bit strange. Basically if the alpha value of a color is greater than a threshold, it makes it brighterish. This
additional brightness can also be sin waved.

It effectively makes thing look more like a lightsaber, where the color doesn't come from the center but the edges

DISCLAIMER: This shader does actually draw black background of textures. Ask me (Linty) if you need help converting 
one to transparent. Also, this shader might take some finicking to make look right

---------------------------
Variables:
uColor --> Changes the color. Some colors look better than others (try using Deep Pink instead of Pink, for example)
uTime --> Input for a sinwave that changes the instentity of the brightening (use a timer but slow it down alot) 
uOpacity --> The threshold for what gets brightened (alpha ranges from 0 to 1 btw)
uSaturation --> Controls the intensity of the sin wave

---------------------------
Default Values: (These have to be manually put in)

uColor --> (when would you not use a color man)

uTime --> 0 (setting to a constant makes it so it doesn't do the wave) 
- Alternatively --> MathHelper.Pi / 2 adds the maximum glow while 3 * MathHelper.Pi / 2 give the minimum

uOpacity --> 0.4 (remember that lower = more brightness)

uSaturation --> 1.2

Example (lets say this is in the PreDraw of a projectile):
